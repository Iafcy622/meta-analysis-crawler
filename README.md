# Meta-Analysis Crawler

A crawler for PubMed Meta-analysis articles

## Configurations

API keys for PubMed and OpenAI are needed.

For PubMed, make an account in [NCBI](https://account.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and get the api key in [Settings](https://account.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/settings/).

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```shell
PUBMED_API_KEY=YOURPUBMEDAPIKEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUROPENAIAPIKEY
```
